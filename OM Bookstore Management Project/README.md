"# Om Bookstore Project Analysis

## Overview
This project was conducted for Om Bookstore, located in Vegas Mall, as a freelance Data Analyst. The initiative focused on building a database, performing SQL-based analysis, and providing actionable recommendations. While a Medium blog inspires the dataset used and is not real, the questions and analytical approach reflect the work done for the bookstore.

Blog: Explaining the Process
In my blog, I delve deeper into the process and methodology behind this case study. I discuss the significance of each step, from data cleaning to generating insights. This includes a breakdown of challenges encountered during analysis, the rationale behind chosen techniques, and reflections on the outcomes. The blog is an educational resource for anyone interested in SQL and data analytics.

## Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

### Cleaning Process
- Renamed misspelled columns.
- Removed duplicate entries in the province column.
- Resolved inconsistencies between province and city values.
- Created a backup schema before performing any data-cleaning tasks.

## Key SQL Queries

### 1. How many days is the data period?
```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date)) AS total_days
FROM Orders;
```

### 2. Total number of books
```sql
SELECT COUNT(book_id) AS total_books
FROM book_info;
```

### 3. Books with above-average pages
```sql
SELECT book_name, number_of_pages
FROM book_info
WHERE number_of_pages > (SELECT AVG(number_of_pages) FROM book_info)
ORDER BY number_of_pages;
```

### 4. Publisher with most books
```sql
SELECT p.publisher_id, p.name AS publisher, COUNT(bi.publisher_id) AS total
FROM book_info bi
JOIN publisher p ON bi.publisher_id = p.publisher_id
GROUP BY p.publisher_id, publisher
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 5. Total revenue
```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_price) AS revenue
FROM Order_items;
```

### 6. Online sales
```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_books_sold
FROM Order_items;
```

### 7. Province with most invoices
```sql
SELECT c.province, COUNT(o.order_id) AS invoice_count
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.province
ORDER BY invoice_count DESC;
```
