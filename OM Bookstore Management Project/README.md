# Om Bookstore Project Analysis

## Overview
This project was conducted for Om Bookstore, located in Vegas Mall, as a freelance Data Analyst. The initiative focused on building a database, performing SQL-based analysis, and providing actionable recommendations. While a Medium blog inspires the dataset used and is not real, the questions and analytical approach reflect the work done for the bookstore.

Blog: Explaining the Process
In my blog, I delve deeper into the process and methodology behind this case study. I discuss the significance of each step, from data cleaning to generating insights. This includes a breakdown of challenges encountered during analysis, the rationale behind chosen techniques, and reflections on the outcomes. The blog is an educational resource for anyone interested in SQL and data analytics.

## Data Preparation and Cleanup
This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

### Cleaning Process
- Renamed misspelled columns.
- Removed duplicate entries in the province column.
- Resolved inconsistencies between province and city values.
- Created a backup schema before performing any data-cleaning tasks.

## Key SQL Queries

### 1. How many days is the data period?
```sql
SELECT DATEDIFF(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date)) AS total_days
FROM Orders;
```

### 2. Total number of books
```sql
SELECT COUNT(book_id) AS total_books
FROM book_info;
```

### 3. Books with above-average pages
```sql
SELECT book_name, number_of_pages
FROM book_info
WHERE number_of_pages > (SELECT AVG(number_of_pages) FROM book_info)
ORDER BY number_of_pages;
```

### 4. Publisher with most books
```sql
SELECT p.publisher_id, p.name AS publisher, COUNT(bi.publisher_id) AS total
FROM book_info bi
JOIN publisher p ON bi.publisher_id = p.publisher_id
GROUP BY p.publisher_id, publisher
ORDER BY total DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 5. Total revenue
```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity * unit_price) AS revenue
FROM Order_items;
```

### 6. Online sales
```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_books_sold
FROM Order_items;
```

### 7. Which Province has the most invoices?
```sql
SELECT 
   c.province, COUNT(o.order_id) as invoice_number
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN Order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY invoice_number
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
### 8. Who is the best customer?
```sql
SELECT 
 o.customer_id, fist_name, last_name,
    COUNT(oi.quantity) as total_book,
    SUM(quantity * unit_price) as money_spent
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN Order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 5 DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

### 9. Who is writing Horror books?
```sql
SELECT author, book_name
FROM book_info bi
JOIN genre g ON bi.genre_id = g.genre_id
WHERE g.name = "Horror";
```

### 10. First, find which artist has earned the most according to the InvoiceLines.
```sql
WITH tbl_best_selling_author AS(
    SELECT 
  author,
        SUM(oi.unit_price * oi.quantity) AS total_sales
 FROM book_info bi
 JOIN Order_items oi ON bi.book_id = oi.product_id
 GROUP BY author
 ORDER BY total_sales DESC
 LIMIT 10
)SELECT 
 bsa.author,
    SUM(oi.unit_price * oi.quantity) AS amount_spent, 
    c.customer_id, c.fist_name, c.last_name
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN Order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN book_info bi ON oi.product_id = bi.book_id
JOIN tbl_best_selling_author bsa ON bi.author = bsa.author
GROUP BY bsa.author,
         c.customer_id,
         c.first_name,
         c.last_name
ORDER BY amount_spent DESC;
```

### 11. We want to find out the most popular book Genre for each Province.
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE
    tbl_sales_per_province AS(
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS purchases_per_genre, province, g.name as genre, g.genre_id
  FROM Customers c
  JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
  JOIN Order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
  JOIN book_info bi ON oi.product_id = bi.book_id
  JOIN genre g ON bi.genre_id = g.genre_id
  GROUP BY 2,3,4
  ORDER BY 1 DESC
 )
 ,tbl_max_genre_per_province AS(SELECT MAX(purchases_per_genre) AS max_genre_number, province
  FROM tbl_sales_per_province
  GROUP BY 2
  ORDER BY 2)SELECT tbl_sales_per_province.* 
FROM tbl_sales_per_province
JOIN tbl_max_genre_per_province ON tbl_sales_per_province.province = tbl_max_genre_per_province.province
WHERE tbl_sales_per_province.purchases_per_genre = tbl_max_genre_per_province.max_genre_number;
```

### 12. Write a query that determines the customer that has spent the most on books for each province.
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE 
   tbl_customer_with_province AS (
     SELECT c.customer_id, fist_name, last_name, province,SUM(oi.quantity*oi.unit_price) AS total_spending
     FROM Order_items oi
     JOIN Orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id
     JOIN Customers c ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
     GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
     ORDER BY 2,3 DESC),   tbl_province_max_spending AS(
     SELECT province, MAX(total_spending) AS max_spending
     FROM tbl_customer_with_province
     GROUP BY 1)SELECT 
    tbl_cp.province, tbl_cp.customer_id, tbl_cp.fist_name, tbl_cp.last_name, tbl_cp.total_spending
FROM tbl_customer_with_province tbl_cp
JOIN tbl_province_max_spending tbl_ms
   ON tbl_cp.province = tbl_ms.province
WHERE tbl_cp.total_spending = tbl_ms.max_spending
ORDER BY 1;
```
